# Experience Self-Serve With Default Configuration 

------------------------------------------------------------------


Milestone 1 in Customer onboarding is to be able to see how easily Self-Serve can be customized and see it in action, as soon as possible. This step normally takes an hour(tentatively)

2. [ ] Customize Self-Serve for your business
    
    2.1  After you have clicked on the magic link you received in your inbox, you will be able to Create your Product and choose your Persona with intent
