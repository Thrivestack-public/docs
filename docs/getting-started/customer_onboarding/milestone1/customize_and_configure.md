# Experience Self-Serve With Default Configuration 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Milestone 1 in Customer onboarding is to be able to see how easily Self-Serve can be customized and see it in action, as soon as possible. This step normally takes an hour (tentatively).

In this step, we will help you:

1. Signup to [www.ThriveStack.ai](www.ThriveStack.ai)

2. Customize Self-Serve for your business

   2.1. After you have clicked on the magic link you received in your inbox, you will be able to:

   - Create your Product and choose your Persona with intent.

   2.2. Choose your application type, whether it’s used by “Business” or “Consumers”.

   ![Self-Serve Templates](/img/customer_onboarding/self-serve-templates.png)

   2.3. Select whether you have your own Authentication implemented or you would need ThriveStack to implement Authentication for you:

   - Prosumer
   - COGS Efficient
   - Traditional SaaS

   2.4. Select the Self-Serve Template that suits your business and click “Next”. [Learn more](https://resources.thrivestack.ai/p/announcing-self-serve-templates)

   2.5. Clicking “Next” will start the deployment of your Self-Serve you just customized for your Product, and take you to a simulated experience of Self-Serve.

   2.6. Upon completing the Self-Serve deployment and simulation, you would have received two emails:

   - 2.6.1. First email demonstrates your End User notification, that they will receive upon signing up to your Product.

   - 2.6.2. Second email demonstrates the notification that your GTM Team will receive when your End Users sign up.

3. Complete Self-Serve with ThriveStack’s default configuration. You can change these configurations to your environment specific configuration any time

   3.1. With the above steps completed, you have successfully Customized your Self-Serve, and now you are ready to experience firsthand what your End Users will experience, and, ready to integrate with your Product’s development environment. You should see an “Integration checklist” now
