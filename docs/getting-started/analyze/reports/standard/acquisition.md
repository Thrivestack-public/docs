### Integration Steps for Acquisition Report Setup

To generate an Retention Report, you can choose **one of the following two methods** based on your preference:

1. **Configure Self-Serve Workflow**:
    - With the self-serve, you need to set it up initially. Once configured, the self-serve system will automatically handle all your standard events, such as user signups, account creations, and other relevant events.. [Set up Self-Serve](https://dev.app.thrivestack.ai/build/setup/quick-start/)
2. **Configure Telemetry APIs**:
    - If you prefer not to use the self-serve option, you can send telemetry events via telemetry APIs. Here is the [link to the API documentation](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/overview). 

### Expected events and API calls are:

- **Track API:**
  - [signed_up](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/events/standard/signed_up) event.
  - [account_created](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/events/standard/account_created) event
  - [account_created](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/events/standard/account_created) event
  

- **Group Call:**
  - For [account creation](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/identification/group)

- **Identify Call:**
  - For [user signup](https://docs.dev.app.thrivestack.ai/getting-started/analyze/instrumentation/identification/user)
