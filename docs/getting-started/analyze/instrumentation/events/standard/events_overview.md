## Key Takeaways

### Event Influence on Reports:

- Different events impact various reports (e.g., Acquisition, Retention, Virality, Activation, Revenue).
- Understanding these influences helps optimize product features and user engagement.

### Pre-built Events vs. Custom Events:

- **Pre-built Events:** Already included in self-serveâ€”no coding effort required.
- **Custom Events:** Focus on implementing these; they provide flexibility tailored to your application.
