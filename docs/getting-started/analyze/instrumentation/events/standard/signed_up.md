# Signed up

# 1. Introduction

The goal is to generate a ‘signed up’ event that enables SaaS builders to track when users sign up for their product.

## 1.2. Track API

The `/track` endpoint is used to track events or actions performed by users. It allows you to associate and update event information as property.

### 1.2.1. Event Parameters

To complete this step, you need to provide four pieces of information: the first is the event name, the second is the user ID, the third is additional properties associated with the event, and the fourth is the timestamp.

| Parameter   | Type   | Description                                           |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| event_name  | String | The name of the event being tracked.                  |
| properties  | Object | Additional properties associated with the event.       |
| user_id     | String | The unique identifier of the user triggering the event. |
| timestamp   | Date   | Date the user’s account was first created. Recommends using ISO-8601 date strings. |
| context (optional) | Object | Context is a dictionary of extra information that provides useful context about a datapoint. |

### 1.2.2. Event Properties

The following properties of how an event is described by a schema:

| Property    | Type   | Description                                  |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| email       | String | The email of the user.                      |
| name        | String | The name of the user.                       |
| first_name  | String | The first name of the user.                 |
| last_name   | String | The last name of the user.                  |

### 1.2.3. Sample

```json
{
    "event": "event_name",
    "properties": {
        "property1": "value1",
        "property2": "value2"
    },
    "user_id": "user123",
    "timestamp": "20-11-23T22:28:55.111Z"
}
```
