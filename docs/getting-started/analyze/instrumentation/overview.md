## Instrumentation

The **Instrumentation** framework enables the tracking and analysis of user interactions through key concepts and APIs. Below is an overview of how these elements work together:

### Key Concepts and APIs

- **[Users â†’ Identify API](./identification/user)**
    - Purpose: Identifies users by capturing their unique details, such as name and email.
    - Focus: Who is the user?

- **[Groups â†’ Group API](./identification/group)**
    - Purpose: Links users to specific accounts or organizations they belong to.
    - Focus: What account or organization does the user belong to?

- **[Events â†’ Track API](./events/event-tracking)**
    - Purpose: Records user actions and interactions with the product (events).
    - Focus: What are the users doing?

- **[Pages â†’ Page API](./identification/page)**
    - Purpose: Monitors and tracks the pages a user visits.
    - Focus: Which pages are the users visiting?

By leveraging the **Identify**, **Group**, **Page**, and **Track** APIs, you gain powerful insights into user behavior and engagement, allowing you to optimize your product for better performance and user experience.
