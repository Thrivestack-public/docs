# Enrichment

## Objective:
User Data Enrichment enhances existing user data by integrating additional information from external sources. This process enriches basic user profiles (e.g., email addresses) with more comprehensive details, offering a more complete understanding of users.

The enrichment functionality in the system supports integration with People Data and Clearbit. To utilize this feature, API keys from these providers are required.

## Configuration:
- Input API keys from People Data and Clearbit.
- Select the 'Customize' option in the right-hand panel to choose the additional data to collect, such as company details, user roles, and demographic information.
