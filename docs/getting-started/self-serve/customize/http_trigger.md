# HTTP Trigger

## Objective:
The "HTTP Trigger" serves as the starting point in the user signup workflow.

## Configuration:
- Find the 'HTTP Trigger' node in the workflow builder and select it to access its settings in the right pane.
- Enter your custom domain details. Without a custom domain, users will default to being redirected to ThriveStack's subdomain.
